            <p>I love salads and it hurts me when they're treated just as a sad and clean side dish. I try to give salads the significance they earn, as a complete and succulent course, and I hope my salads can inspire others to try them and enjoy a healthy diet, as I do.</p>

            <p>A few favorites are strawberries, grapes, bananas, and apples. Depending on the season, you can add watermelon, kiwi, blueberries, or raspberries. Fruits like peaches and nectarines don't work as well because they are slippery and change color very quickly.</p>

                    <h3>Kids not eating enough vegetables.</h3>
                    <p>It's surprising how quickly a platter of rainbow coloured vegetable batons will disappear when left on the table.Try to make vegetables a part of every meal. Depending on the age of the children you'll be cooking for, you're likely to have far more success if you get kids involved in the selection process.I love seeing how excited my kids are when they spot a new vegetable growing in the garden.Incorporate vegetables into meals the kids already enjoy.</p>

                    <h3>Chefs are masters at trickery.</h3>
                    <p>Somehow, everything tastes better with olive oil.If you don't like olive oil, try adding a squeeze of lemon juice to broccoli, green beans, asparagus or any other vegetable.Whether balsamic, wine or apple cider, vinegar is marvellous with veg.Chop fresh herbs such as parsley, dill, chives or basil, then sprinkle them over beans, carrots, peas and other vegetables just before serving.Add 1 or 2 cloves or a few slivers of sliced garlic or chopped onion to your vegetables.You can toast flaked almonds, chopped pecans or hazelnuts, or any seeds such as sesame, sunflower or pepitas.A few crumbles of feta cheese improve just about everything – you don’t have to use a lot.</p>
