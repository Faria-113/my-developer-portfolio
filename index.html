            <p>I love salads and it hurts me when they're treated just as a sad and clean side dish. I try to give salads the significance they earn, as a complete and succulent course, and I hope my salads can inspire others to try them and enjoy a healthy diet, as I do.</p>

            <h2>Must Have Fruits For salad Bowl</h2>
            <p>A few favorites are strawberries, grapes, bananas, and apples. Depending on the season, you can add watermelon, kiwi, blueberries, or raspberries. Fruits like peaches and nectarines don't work as well because they are slippery and change color very quickly.</p>
